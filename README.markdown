Basics
======

Trommelyd for Android is an Android application (*duh..*).

It is designed to work on most (all?) devices, and should support Android 1.5 and
above.

If you would like to build this yourself, you should use the [Android SDK] [1]
2.2 or above, due to manifest features only available from this version. The
application will still build for, and run, on earlier versions.
